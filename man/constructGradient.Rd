\usage{
constructGradient(hM, focalVariable, non.focalVariables = list(),
  ngrid = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{focalVariable}{focal variable over which the gradient is constructed}

\item{ngrid}{number of points along the gradient (for continuous focal variable)}

\item{non.focalVariable}{assumptions on how non-focal variables co-vary with the focal variable}
}
\value{
a named list with members \code{XDataNew}, \code{studyDesignNew} and \code{rLNew}
}
\description{
Constructs an environmental gradient over one of the variables included in \code{XData}
}
\details{
non.focalVariables is a list, of which each element is of form variable=list(type,value).
where variable is one of the non-focal variables, and the value is needed only if type = 3
type = 1 sets the values of the non-focal variable
to the most likely value (defined as expected value for covarites, mode for factors)
type = 2 sets the values of the non-focal variable to most likely value, given the value of focal variable,
based on linear relationship
type = 3 fixes to the value given.
if a non.focalVariable is not listed, type=2 is used as default
note that if focal variable is continuous, selecting type 2 for a non-focal categorical variable can cause abrupt changes in response
}
\examples{
# Construct gradient for environmental covariate called 'x1'.
Gradient = constructGradient(TD$m, focalVariable="x1")

# Construct gradient for environmental covariate called 'x1'
# while setting the other covariate to its most likely values
Gradient = constructGradient(TD$m, focalVariable="x1",non.focalVariables=list(x2=list(1)))
