\usage{
computePredictedValues(hM, partition = NULL, partition.sp = NULL,
  start = 1, Yc = NULL, mcmcStep = 1, expected = TRUE,
  initPar = NULL, nParallel = 1, nChains = length(hM$postList),

}
\arguments{
\item{partition}{vector of observations partitioning for cross-validation}

\item{partition.sp}{vector of species partitioning for conditional cross-validation}

\item{start}{index of first MCMC sample included}

\item{Yc}{response matrix on which the predictions are to be conditioned on}

\item{mcmcStep}{number of MCMC steps used to make conditional predictions}

\item{expected}{whether expected values (TRUE) or realizations (FALSE) are to be predicted}
}
\description{
Computes predicted values from the trained model
}
\details{
If the option partition is not used, the posterior predictive distribution is based on the model
fitted to the full data. If the option partition is used but partition.sp is not used, the  posterior predictive distribution
is based on cross-validation over the sampling units. If partition.sp is additionally used, when predictions are made for
each fold of the sampling units, the predictions are done separately for each fold of species. When making the predictions
for one fold of species, the predictions are conditional on known occurrences (those observed in the data) of the species
belonging to the other folds. If partition.sp is used, the parameter mcmcStep should be set to high enough value to obtain
appropriate conditional predictions. The option Yc can be used alternatively to partition.sp if the conditioning is to be done
to a fixed set of data (independent on which sampling unit and species the predictions are made for).
